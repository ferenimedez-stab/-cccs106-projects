    <br> <i>sniffio</i> -> 1.3.1 

## Programs Created

### 1. hello_world.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Displays student information (name, student number, program, year), age calculation, and system information.
- **Notes:** Ensure accurate input information.

### 2. basic_calculator.py
- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Features:** Basic arithmetic, square root, min/max calculation, error handling
- **Notes:** 
<br> - The calculator can  handle positive and negative values. 
<br> - Alphabets and other characters aside from numbers are treated as invalid input.
<br> - Make sure to review program calculations.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Activating Virtual Environment:** In creating an environment, an error resulted in the failed activation of the created virtual environment. To resolve this issue, utilise Command Prompt (CMD) in both creation and activation of custom environment instead of the terminal in Visual Studio Code or that of other code editors.

## Learning Outcomes

During the conduct of this lab activity, repeated virtual environment creation, program testing, and documentation revisions would've been prevented had I gave time reading instructions carefully.
